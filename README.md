The proposed method consists of electronic notice board that is controlled by an android device and displays message on it.
   Traditionally, there were notice boards where any information or notice had to be stick daily. This becomes tedious and requires daily maintenance. The project the overcomes this problem by introducing an electronic display notice board interfaced to an android device through Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth receives the message from android device that is sent to an Arduino.Notice board is a primary thing in any institution/organization or public utility places like bus stations, railway stations andparks.
    The Notice board is a common display for effective mode of providing information to the people, but this is not easy for updating the messages instantly. This project deals about an advanced Hi-Tech wireless Notice Board. This system is enhanced to display the latest information through an Android application ofsmart phones or tablet.
   
    
    Developed a digital notice board to display various elements which can be operated easily through mobile phone and Arduino.
 Code inserted in Arduino and uses Bluetooth module
 Application used through mobile phone : E&E-Arduino and Automation
